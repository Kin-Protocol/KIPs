## Summary

The KIN team is proposing a potential burn event for KIN, and they want to engage in a dialogue with the community to determine what level of burn would be considered satisfactory.

## Motivation

Determining the ideal burn percentage for a cryptocurrency is a complex decision that requires careful consideration of various factors. The KIN team has evaluated the current market conditions, tokenomics, and goals of the KIN project, and they suggest exploring other community engagement initiatives to jumpstart community engagement.

## Specification

Based on the current circulating supply of KIN and the maximum supply of KIN, a burn percentage that would be significant enough to have an impact on the KIN ecosystem while still being sustainable would be around 5-10%. However, the decision to burn KIN should not be taken lightly and should be thoroughly evaluated by the KIN team. The KIN community should be involved in this decision-making process, and if they decide to move forward with a burn, a voting campaign should be conducted to ensure that the community is fully informed before making any decisions.

## Security

## Implementation

Regarding the suggestion of burning 2-3 trillion KIN, the KIN team suggests conducting a thorough analysis of the potential impact and involving the KIN community in this decision-making process. They recommend outlining the potential impact on KIN's price and market capitalization, the effect on KIN holders, and the long-term sustainability of the KIN ecosystem to ensure that the community is fully informed before making any decisions.

## KIN Improvement Proposal (KIP) request: Community Vote on KIN Burn Percentage, Public Statement Coming from the KIN TEAM [3]

Title: KIP-005: KIP Public Statement Coming from the KIN TEAM [3]


Community Vote on KIN Burn Percentage


Dear KIN community,
We are writing to share with you a proposal regarding a potential burn event for KIN. As you know, determining the ideal burn percentage for a cryptocurrency is a complex decision that requires careful consideration of various factors. We have evaluated the current market conditions, tokenomics, and goals of the KIN project, and have come up with some ideas to share with you.


Firstly, it is important to consider the potential consequences of a burn event, such as the impact on the circulating supply, market demand, and overall token value. Additionally, we must consider how this action will be received by the community and other stakeholders.
We believe that it is crucial for the KIN team to engage in a dialogue with the community to determine what level of burn would be considered satisfactory. We suggest exploring other community engagement initiatives, such as marketing and promotional campaigns, partnerships with other projects, and the development of new use cases for KIN to jumpstart community engagement.


Based on the current circulating supply of KIN and the maximum supply of KIN, a burn percentage that would be significant enough to have an impact on the KIN ecosystem while still being sustainable would be around 5-10%. This would equate to burning 110 billion to 220 billion KIN. However, the decision to burn KIN should not be taken lightly and should be thoroughly evaluated by the KIN team.


Regarding the suggestion of burning 2-3 trillion KIN, it is essential to evaluate this proposal carefully before implementing it. Burning a significant amount of KIN could potentially have a positive effect on KIN's price and market capitalization, but it could also lead to unforeseen consequences, such as reducing the liquidity of KIN and potentially harming the KIN ecosystem.
Therefore, we suggest conducting a thorough analysis of the potential impact of burning 2-3 trillion KIN and determining whether this action aligns with the long-term vision and goals of the KIN ecosystem. We also recommend involving the KIN community in this decision-making process and seeking feedback and input from stakeholders to ensure that any decision made aligns with the interests and needs of the KIN community.


If the KIN community decides to move forward with a burn, we recommend a voting campaign that includes outlining the outlook of each outcome so that the community can truly understand what is in store for the long-term roadmap of KIN. We suggest laying out the potential impact on KIN's price and market capitalization, the effect on KIN holders, and the long-term sustainability of the KIN ecosystem to ensure that the community is fully informed before making any decisions.
We hope that this proposal provides clarity on the potential benefits and risks of a burn event and that it helps to inform the community's decision-making process. We look forward to hearing your feedback and continuing to work together to build a thriving KIN ecosystem.


Sincerely,
CITZEN CAPET
