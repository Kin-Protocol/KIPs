## Summary

This KIP proposes a community vote on the ideal burn percentage for KIN tokens, with a suggested range of 5-10% (equating to burning 110 billion to 220 billion KIN). The proposal aims to engage the KIN community in shaping the future of the ecosystem and ensure that any decision made aligns with the interests and needs of the community.

## Motivation

The author of the KIP is a long-time KIN holder and believes that community engagement and a community vote on the burn percentage will help the KIN ecosystem move forward in a positive direction. The author suggests that burning KIN tokens may have a positive impact on the ecosystem, and engaging the community in this decision-making process will ensure that any decision made aligns with the interests and needs of the KIN community.

## Specification

The proposed community vote will be conducted via a smart contract that allows KIN holders to vote on their preferred burn percentage option. To participate, KIN holders will need to hold a minimum amount of KIN tokens in their wallet. The exact minimum amount required will be determined by the KIN team. The author suggests that the KIN team conducts a thorough analysis of the potential impact of burning 2-3 trillion KIN and seeks feedback and input from stakeholders.

## Security

The proposed community vote will be conducted via a smart contract, which should ensure the security and integrity of the vote. However, the KIN team will need to ensure that the smart contract is properly audited and tested to prevent any vulnerabilities or exploits.

## Implementation

The KIP suggests that the KIN team engages in a dialogue with the community to determine what level of burn would be considered satisfactory and explores other community engagement initiatives, such as marketing and promotional campaigns, partnerships with other projects, and the development of new use cases for KIN. The KIN team will also need to determine the exact minimum amount of KIN required to participate in the community vote and ensure that the smart contract is properly audited and tested.

## KIN Improvement Proposal (KIP) request: Community Vote on KIN Burn Percentage Formal Draft [2]


Title: KIP-004: Community Vote on KIN Burn Percentage Formal Draft [2]

Introduction:
As a long-time KIN holder since 2018, I am excited to propose a KIP to the KIN community. This proposal aims to engage the community in a dialogue about the optimal burn percentage for KIN and to give the community a voice in shaping the future of the KIN ecosystem.

Proposal:
Based on various factors, including the current market conditions, the tokenomics of KIN, the goals of the project, and the impact of a potential burn on the overall ecosystem, I propose that the ideal burn percentage for KIN would be around 5-10%. This would equate to burning 110 billion to 220 billion KIN.

However, I recognize that this decision should not be taken lightly and should be thoroughly evaluated by the KIN team. Therefore, I propose that we engage in a dialogue with the community to determine what level of burn would be considered satisfactory. Additionally, the KIN team may want to explore other community engagement initiatives, such as marketing and promotional campaigns, partnerships with other projects, and the development of new use cases for KIN.

I also suggest that we conduct a thorough analysis of the potential impact of burning 2-3 trillion KIN and determine whether this action aligns with the long-term vision and goals of the KIN ecosystem. We should involve the KIN community in this decision-making process and seek feedback and input from stakeholders to ensure that any decision made aligns with the interests and needs of the KIN community.

Community Vote:
To facilitate community engagement and ensure that every KIN holder has a voice, I propose that we conduct a community vote on the burn options. The community vote will be conducted via a smart contract, which will allow KIN holders to vote on their preferred burn percentage option.

To participate in the community vote, KIN holders will need to hold a minimum amount of KIN tokens in their wallet. The exact minimum amount of KIN tokens required to participate in the vote will be determined by the KIN team.

Conclusion:
As a long-time KIN holder, I am passionate about the success of the KIN ecosystem and believe that this proposal will help us move forward in a positive direction. By engaging in a dialogue with the community and conducting a community vote, we can ensure that the interests and needs of the KIN community are heard and taken into consideration.
I encourage all KIN holders to participate in the community vote and make their voice heard. Together, we can shape the future of the KIN ecosystem and achieve sustainable growth and engagement.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
CITZEN CAPET
