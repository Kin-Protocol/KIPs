# KIP 003 - Protocol Staking Incentives 

### The goal of KIP 003 is create a staking incentive.  Our intention is to borrow from already successful protocol staking mechanisms.

We're going to use AAVE as a case study because their safety module is the exact kind of incentive system we want to create.
What makes this an effective incentive system is that it encourages participation in securing the protocol and that its simple and transparent.  

Firstly, let's get a general sense of how AAVE network bootstapped their staking and some of the loose numbers in the reserve.

- AAVE has a total supply of 16 million AAVE tokens so the chosen AAVE emissions rate for the protocol staking incentives is 1,100 AAVE per day emitted.

- The supply is fixed.

- Protocol staking emissions for AAVE are the only emissions source, and they come from the ecosystem reserve.

- The ecosystem reserve is designed to last for only a couple of years currently.

- The initial ecosystem reserve amount had 3 million AAVE at the time of token inception.

Currently the only usage for the reserve funds is staking rewards.  However the decentralized governance can decide to use the treasury funds for governance if they choose in future, I would suggest the same for Kin's new decentralized governance.

There are current discussions in the AAVE governance forum about the long term sustainability of the protocol treasury from protocol fees and other proposals with the GHO (Ghost) stable coin; GHO will be minted as a loan against Aave V3 assets deposited by users into the protocol 
Of the 1,100 Aave emitted daily; 550 Aave each are split between AAVE and ABPT stakers; these are the two staking options
There is no minimum or maximum staking period but there is a 10-Day cooldown period and a 2-Day window to unstake 

### Here is my proposal for the KIN Protocol Staking Emissions - 
With 16 Million AAVE in reserves to start at 1,110 AAVE per day the emission percentage is .006875% of Total Reserve per day
If we say that the **Kin Staking Reserves will be 100 Billion**, the formula could look like this below
With **100 Billion KIN in reserves to start, multiplied by the emission percentage of .006875% of Total Reserve per day** …  That would mean **6,875,000 million KIN per day** in rewards for stakers
There are 31,536,000 seconds per year
**2,509,375,000 KIN released each year**
**79.5 KIN per second**
The unknown will be how much KIN is staked at any given time, but the formula would look like this (79.5 emissions per second x 31,536,000 / current stakes)
So for an example let’s say 200,000,000,000 Kin were staked at any time which is 10% of the total current circulating supply, we get this below on line 23
79.5 Kin Emissions Per Second x 31,536,000 seconds per year / 200,000,000,000 = .01254 Kin per second for each Kin Staked 
The staking reserves with these numbers lasts for 39.85 years
