## KIN Improvement Proposal (KIP) request: Community Vote on KIN Burn Percentage Draft [1]


Dear KIN community,

As a long-time KIN holder since 2018, I have carefully considered the idea of implementing a burn for KIN and would like to share my thoughts with you.

Determining the ideal burn percentage for a cryptocurrency involves considering various factors such as market conditions, tokenomics, project goals, and the impact on the ecosystem. It is important for the KIN team to carefully evaluate the potential consequences of a burn, such as the impact on the circulating supply, market demand, and overall token value, as well as the potential reception from the community and other stakeholders.

To increase community engagement, the KIN team could engage in a dialogue with the community to determine what level of burn would be considered satisfactory and explore other community engagement initiatives, such as marketing campaigns, partnerships, and the development of new use cases for KIN.

Based on the current circulating supply of KIN and the maximum supply of KIN, a burn percentage that would be significant enough to have an impact on the KIN ecosystem while still being sustainable would be around 5-10%, which would equate to burning 110 billion to 220 billion KIN. However, this decision should not be taken lightly and should be thoroughly evaluated by the KIN team, taking into account the potential impact on the KIN market, the effect on KIN holders, and the long-term sustainability of the KIN ecosystem.

Regarding the suggestion of burning 2-3 trillion KIN, it is essential to evaluate this proposal carefully before implementing it. Burning a significant amount of KIN could potentially have a positive effect on KIN's price and market capitalization, but it could also lead to unforeseen consequences, such as reducing the liquidity of KIN and potentially harming the KIN ecosystem. Therefore, it is crucial to conduct a thorough analysis of the potential impact of burning 2-3 trillion KIN and determine whether this action aligns with the long-term vision and goals of the KIN ecosystem.

To ensure that any decision made aligns with the interests and needs of the KIN community, it is important to involve the community in the decision-making process and seek feedback and input from stakeholders. A solid voting campaign around this could be a sure way of increasing community engagement, especially if majority vote rules. However, it is essential to lay out the outlook of each outcome so that the community can understand what is in store for the long-term roadmap of KIN.

In conclusion, implementing a burn event for KIN requires a thorough analysis and careful evaluation of various factors, and it is crucial to involve the KIN community in the decision-making process to ensure that any decision made aligns with the interests and needs of the community. As a long-time KIN holder since 2018, I strongly advise the KIN team to consider all options and potential outcomes before deciding on implementing a burn event.

Best regards,
CITZEN CAPET
