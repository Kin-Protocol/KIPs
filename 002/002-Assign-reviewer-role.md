## Summary

This proposal is an initial test proposal for the governance system to assign a role of reviewer to Kin Community member Will Gikandi.  This is to test the application of reviewer roles. This role will initially have no functionality in the programs that handle governance but they will have control of the GitHub repos and SPL program deploy authority.

## Motivation

In order to stand up a decentralized autonomous system we have to entrust some engineers with the construction and review of it, while empowering the community to hold them accountable.  The role of review would be responsible for vetting the intital code to construct the autonomous system.
